[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmhodges/clock.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmhodges/clock)

Package clock provides an abstraction for system time that enables
testing of time-sensitive code.

Where you'd use time.Now, instead use clk.Now where clk is an instance
of Clock.

When running your code in production, pass it a Clock given by
Default() and when you're running it in your tests, pass it an instance of Clock from NewFake().

When you do that, you can use FakeClock's the Add and Set methods to
control how time behaves in your code making them more reliable while
also expanding the space of problems you can test.

Be sure to test Time equality with time.Time#Equal, not ==.

For documentation, see the
[godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/jmhodges/clock).
